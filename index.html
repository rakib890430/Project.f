            <p>Let me introduce myself first. My name is Rakibul Hasan and I am studying <br>Computer Science in
                Engineering. I
                want
                to be a full-time front-end developer. <br>I don't have much programming experience in general. I'm

            <h2>Dream Big</h2>
            <h3>Become a Web Developer</h3>
            <p>After deciding I wanted to get into web development the first question on my mind was “What do I learn?”
                After doing some research, I ended up making my learning path based on what most entry-level web
                developer positions asked for, which was:
                JavaScript
                HTML & CSS
                CSS Preprocessors (Less & Sass)
                Responsive Design
                AngularJS
                Design Patterns.
                Git</p>

                <p>The beginning was a lot of trouble though now it seems a lot easier.
                    But I think there are many
                    things to consider for those interested in a careerin dev elopment. First, you need an
                    emotion
                    to
                    write the code. web is moving fast, and being able to keep up with it will be a big part
                    of
                    your
                    job.</p>

                <p>There is no ideal way to start this journey. As a resource, information is extensive.
                    You can feel that learning to learn this !! Java may be the primary language for some people.
                    For the other it can be HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
                    Choose a language and then work hard !!
                    If only I had chosen something !! I will start with HTML, learn the basics!!
                    Then start with Python, an easy-to-use language like JavaScript</p>
