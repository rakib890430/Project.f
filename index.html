            <h3>Become a Web Developer</h3>
            <p>After deciding I wanted to get into web development the first question on my mind was “What do I learn?”
                After doing some research, I ended up making my learning path based on what most entry-level web
                developer positions asked for, which was:
                JavaScript
                HTML & CSS
                CSS Preprocessors (Less & Sass)
                Responsive Design
                AngularJS
                Design Patterns.
                Git</p>

                    to

                    your
                    job. Over time you will have to learn new languages ​​and get access<br> to new tools.

                    The ability to solve problems for success in computer<br> science is also logical, rational
                    thinking.
                    Patience and the ability<br>
                    to keep your head cool are also two
                    things that will help you a lot in

        <h3>2021-Strat Learning | As a Developer </h3>
        <p>There is no ideal way to start this journey. As a resource, information is extensive.
            You can feel that learning to learn this !! Java may be the primary language for some people.
            For the other it can be HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
            Choose a language and then work hard !!
            If only I had chosen something !! I will start with HTML, learn the basics!!
            Then start with Python, an easy-to-use language like JavaScript</p>
